# Goal

Create a script which can create and execute a financial action plan.

Main variables to build this plan are current Net Worth and Spending.

Action plan should execute and update net worth until the value reaches a given `GOAL_DOLLARS`

## V1

hardcoded variables and simple dictionaries to address my curiosity.

> note: values used and saved to Git are either targeting averages in florida or spitballed

## Possible Extensions

Incorporate the action plan logic into an API or Lambda and build a frontend.

Include logic to provide an alternative action plan to become debt-free.
